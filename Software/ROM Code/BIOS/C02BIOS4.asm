;C02BIOS version used here is 4.02 (updated release)
; Contains the base BIOS routines in top 2KB of EEPROM
; - Input/Feedback from "BDD" - modified CHRIN/CHROUT I/O routines - saves 12 bytes
; - $F800 - $F9FF 512 bytes for BIOS SC28L92, NMI Panic routine
; - $FA00 - $FDFF reserved for BIOS expansion (1KB)
; - $FE00 - $FE7F reserved for HW (4-I/O selects, 32 bytes wide)
; - $FE80 - $FE9F SC28L92 DUART (32 bytes wide, only 16 bytes used)
; - $FEA0 - $FEFF used for Vector and Hardware configuration data
; - $FF00 - $FFFF JMP table, CPU startup, NMI/BRK/IRQ pre-post routines, Page $03 init, BIOS msg
;
; UPDATES:
; Note: C02BIOS 3.04 is the base for 4.0x.
;
; Fixed IRQ enable for IDE controller. Also streamlined some startup routines. 11th Oct 2020
; Eliminates IDE byte swapping to ensure compatibility with standard formats. 20th January 2021
; Allocate $0400-$04FF for second UART buffer space. 5th February 2021
; Default RTC NVRAM buffer space at $0500-$05FF. 5th February 2021
; Default IDE Block buffer at $0600-$07FF. 5th February 2021
; Panic Routine changed, no longer saves multiple pages, just restores system. 5th February 2021
; New routine to Start Benchmark Counter. Allows counter Start/Stop (pause). 5th February 2021
; Some minor cleanup and fixed a few bugs in the RTC and IDE routines. 14th May 2021
; Update Init and ISR routines to support NXP SC28L92 DUART, both ports and timer. 31st August 2021
; Update Character I/O routines for Serial Ports. Supports on-chip FIFOs Rcv/Xmt. 14th October 2021
; Updates to support IDE as Hitachi MicroDrive (3.3V prototype). 9th August 2021
; Bios 4.00 and later now support multiple block transfers to/from IDE device. 13th September 2021
; Removed Extended Delay (XLdelay) routine, not ever used except for testing. 
;
; Note: C02BIOS 4.01 Updates 17th October, 2021
;
; Streamlined IDE Detection, Initialize and Reset routines.
; - Recalibrate Command removed from Detection, Diagnostics only are run.
; - Likewise, Diagnositcs removed from Reset command, Recalibrate only is done.
; - Removed detection for LBA support, as the Hitachi 3K8 Microdrive supports this natively.
;
; Added support for Receive/Transmit FIFOs for SC28L92 DUART.
;
; Note: C02BIOS 4.02 Updates 31st May, 2022
;
; Rearranged the ISR for the DUART, the two comm ports are now shorter handlers by a few clock
; cycles and the code itself is 12 bytes shorter. The Counter/Timer handler is increased by
; 3 clock cycles. Minor change to RTC ISR, saves a byte and 2 clock cycles ;-)
;
; Minor change to RTC/IDE Inits... saves another 4 bytes ;-)

; NOTE: C02BIOS 4.02 Updates 15th August, 2022
; - No actual code changes!
; - Slight restructuring of routines to minimze any page boundary impacts on clock cycles!
;
; NOTE: C02BIOS 4.02 Updates 15th February, 2023
; - No actual code changes!
; - Slight changes in Page Zero locations. As two bytes were freed up for the SC28L92 BIOS,
;   the two free locations have been moved and labeled near the top of Page Zero, now marked as:
;   SPARE_B0 and SPARE_B1

;Initializing the SC28L92 DUART as a Console.
;An anomaly in the W65C02 processor requires a different approach in programming the SC28L92
; for proper setup/operation. The SC28L92 uses three Mode Registers which are accessed at the same
; register in sequence. There is a command that Resets the Mode Register pointer (to MR0) that is
; issued first. Then MR0/1/2 are loaded in sequence. The problem with the W65C02 is a false read of
; the register when using indexed addressing (i.e., STA UART_REGISTER,X). This results in the Mode
; Register pointer being moved to the next register, so the write to next MRx never happens. While
; the indexed list works fine for all other register functions/commands, the loading of the
; Mode Registers need to be handled separately.
;
;NOTE: the W65C02 will function normally "if" a page boundary is crossed as part of the STA
; (i.e., STA $FDFF,X) where the value of the X Register is high enough to cross the page boundary.
; Programming in this manner would be confusing and require modification if the base I/O address
; is changed for a different hardware I/O map.
;
;There are two routines called to setup the 28L92 DUART:
;
;The first routine is a RESET of the DUART.
; It issues the following sequence of commands:
;  1- Reset Break Change Interrupts
;  2- Reset Receivers
;  3- Reset Transmitters
;  4- Reset All errors
;
;The second routine initializes the 28L92 DUART for operation. It uses two tables of data; one for
; the register offset and the other for the register data. The table for register offsets is
; maintained in ROM. The table for register data is copied to page $03, making it soft data. If
; needed, operating parameters can be altered and the DUART re-initialized via the ROM routine.
;
; Note: A hardware reset will reset the SC28L92 and the default ROM config will be initialized.
; Also note that the Panic routine invoked by a NMI trigger will also reset the DUART to the
; default ROM config.

;BRK/IRQ Interrupt service routines
;The pre-process routine located in page $FF soft-vectors to INTERUPT0/BRKINSTR0 below
;       These are the routines that handle BRK and IRQ functions
;       The BRK handler saves CPU details for register display
;       - A Monitor can provide a disassembly of the last executed instruction
;       - A Received Break is also handled here (ExtraPutty/Windows or Serial/OSX)
;
; SC28L92 handler
;       The 28L92 IRQ routine handles Transmit, Receive, Timer and Received-Break interrupts
;       - Transmit and Receive each have a 128 byte circular FIFO buffer in memory per channel
;       - Xmit IRQ is controlled (On/Off) by the handler and the CHROUT(2) routine
;
; The 28L92 Timer resolution is 10ms and used as a Jiffy Clock for RTC, delays and benchmarking
;
;**************************************************************************************************
;
;BIOS routines to handle interrupt-driven I/O for the SC28L92
;NOTE: IP0 Pin is used for RTS, which is automatically handled in the chip. As a result,
; the upper 2 bits of the ISR are not used in the handler. The Lower 5 bits are used, but
; the lower two are used to determine when to disable transmit after the buffer is empty.
;
;The DUART_ISR bits are defined as follows:

; Bit7          ;Input Change Interrupt
; Bit6          ;Change Break B Interrupt
; Bit5          ;RxRDY B Interrupt
; Bit4          ;TxRDY B Interrupt
; Bit3          ;Counter Ready Interrupt
; Bit2          ;Change Break A Interrupt
; Bit1          ;RxRDY A Interrupt
; Bit0          ;TxRDY A Interrupt
;
; SC8L92 uses all bits in the Status Register!
; - for Receive Buffer full, we set a bit in the SC28L92 Misc. Register, one for each Port.
; Note that the Misc. Register in the SC28L92 is a free byte for storing the flags, as it's
; not used when the DUART is configured in Intel mode! Freebie Register for us to use ;-)
;
; BOTE: The entry point for the BRK/IRQ handler is below at label INTERUPT0

;ISR Routines for SC28L92 Port B
;
; The operation is the same as Port A below, sans the fact that the Break detection only resets
; the DUART channel and returns, while Port A uses Break detection for other functions within
; the BIOS structure, and processes the BRK routine shown further down.

; a bit the SC28L92 Misc. Register. If the buffer has space, we continue.
; 
; To take advantage of the onboard FIFO, we test the RxRDY bit in the Status Register.
; If the bit is set, the FIFO has data and the routine moves data from the FIFO into
; the Receive buffer. We loop back and contnue moving data from the FIFO to the buffer
; until the RxRDY bit is cleared (FIFO empty). If the FIFO is empty, we branch and
; check for a pending Transmit interrupt, just to save some ISR time.
;
; NOTE: the receiver is configured to use the Watchdog function. This will generate a
; receiver interrupt within 64 bit times once data is received (and the FIFO has not
; reached it's configured fill level). This provides the required operation for use
; as a console, as single character commands are common and would not fill the FIFO,
; which generates an interrupt based on the configured FIFO fill level.

;Core routines that are used to detect and configure additional I/O devices.
; The I/O adapter supported by the 4.0x Release of C02BIOS contains two I/O devices:
; - A Maxim DS15x1 Realtime Clock
; - An IDE Device, i.e., IBM/Hitachi MicroDrive
;
; The first routine is to detect the DS15x1 RTC. This is done by reading the NVRAM section
; and testing for the Signature at the end of NVRAM. Obviously, this is something that needs
; to be setup before it can be detected. There is a separate utility that is used to configure
; the RTC for Time/Date, NVRAM usage and the two-byte signature. This utility must be run first
; to properly configure the RTC. Once completed, the BIOS will detect the RTC and read the
; Date and Time to set the BIOS variables accordingly.
;
; The second routine is to detect the IDE device. This can be a bit tricky...
; The first step is to load the status register and check it's contents. If there is no device
; attached, the contents will be a "phantom" I/O address, which is $FE.
; If this happens, simply bypass any additional testing and setup.
; If the contents are other than the "phantom" I/O address, we take additional steps to sense
; the IDE Controller, run Diagnostics, initialize it and add it's ISR into the chain.
;
;**************************************************************************************************
;
;This routine detects the DS15x1 RTC.
; While there's really no standard method to detect the RTC, the NVRAM is initialized
; during the configuration for Date, Time, etc. The last two bytes of the NVRAM will
; contain a 2-byte signature of "KM", in honor of the author ;-)
; If the signature is found, the INIT_RTC routine is called, which will setup the
; RTC variables in Page Zero, where the current Date and Time will be maintained.

;This routine reads the BCD registers from the DS15x1 RTC, converts BCD to Binary and loads the
; BIOS RTC variables. Note that some of the variables are shared to conserve Page Zero space.
; Note: Buffer area used for init is also used by C02 Monitor for hex input and code conversion,
; but is initialized as needed before usage, so we can clobber it here when configuring the BIOS.
;
;As there is a period of time required to get the data from the RTC, convert from BCD, then format
; into the Page Zero locations used, we need to manage the existing Timer/Counter status to ensure
; the best accuracy in time once the routine finishes. In short, the best we can manage accuracy
; is within one second, as the RTC internal update of the registers we read are halted.
;
;To help minimize the timing transfer, we first set the BIOS tick count to it's default value
; to ensure that the software RTC values are not updated during loading from the hardware RTC.
;
; The time to detect and load the current time/date is less than 5000 clock cycles. However, the
; overall accuracy can only be within one second. After the RTC values are transferred, the
; software RTC tick count will not have reached zero, as the entire timing is less than 1ms to
; to read the RTC, convert the BCD data and load the software clock variable in Page Zero. This
; results in software RTC timing starting a 1 second countdown from when the RTC is detected.
; - Note: A Coldstart wouldn't need to reset the Tick Count, but this routine can also be called
;         via the BIOS JMP table, so we reset it here as a safety.

;
;This routine detects the IDE Port
; To detect the IDE controller, it can be a bit tricky. It might take several seconds
; from a physical Reset of the IDE Controller before the Busy flag goes off.
; During this time, any commands sent to the IDE controller will fail. As I like to say,
; "timing is everything". After quite a bit of testing, the easy way to detect the IDE
; controller present is to load the IDE_STATUS register. If an IDE Controller is not
; present, the A Reg will show a phantom address of $FE (high order IDE hardware address)
; and any initialization can be bypassed.
;
; If the IDE controller is present, the IDE_STATUS read may be invalid, so it's necessary
; to test the BUSY flag of the status register. Once the IDE Controller is no longer busy,
; the controller can be initialized. This does create an obvious pause in the startup, but
; ensures that the IDE controller can be reliably detected and initialized at boot time.
;
; A change has been made in the IDE_SETUP routine. As the interrupts were disabled on the
; IDE Controller initially, it needs to be re-enabled before the setup is completed. The short
; bit of code that does this is also called by the Reset-Diag function (JMP $FF00).

;Interrupt 1 - This is the ISR which is responsible for servicing the IDE controller.
; The RTC does not require any ISR capabilities as no Alarm functions are being used in the BIOS.
; There are extra inserts which can be used if needed at a later date.
; The only functions that might make sense would be to add the Alarm function at a future date.
; Once the IDE controller BIOS has matured, if there's any room left in the allocated ROM area,
; I'll revisit it.
;
;The ISR for the IDE controller will handle the data transfer for LBA read/write/verify functions
; and handle any error functions. By design, the 16-bit Data Transfer feature is used for:
; Reading, Writing and Verifying of all LBA block data and the IDE Identification data.
;
;The BIOS is using the Alternate Status register to determine if DRQ (Data Request) is active.
; This works as a handshake for 16-bit data transfers without issue. Note that the normal Status
; register resets the interrupt when read, so this is only done once in the ISR per loop.
;
;Update: This ISR has been moved to the front of the ISR chain, i.e., this ISR routine gets
; serviced first, then jumps to the next ISR, which services the DUART. This makes a noticeable
; improvement in data transfer from the IDE controller. Note that overhead for this routine will
; add 33 clock cycles if it just exits (IDE controller did not generate an interrupt).
;
;To check if an interrupt has been generated by the IDE controller, the Alternate Status register
; will be read. This contains the same information as the standard Status register but will NOT
; reset the interrupt on the IDE controller. By reading the Alternate Status register first, we
; can determine what the status of the IDE controller is and take action if required.
; Note that not all bit settings imply an interrupt was generated. Specifically, looking at the
; bit definitions below, Bits 6 and 4 are set when the IDE is ready, hence a normal condition
; where nothing requires any attention. Also, a Busy condition can imply the IDE controller is
; working on a command but may not have generated an interrupt yet. If The Busy bit (7) is set,
; then all other bits are invalid per Seagate documentation, so we test for that first.
;
;One annoying feature of IDE is "when" interrupts are generated. For any Read operation, once
; the command has been accepted, data is placed into the IDE buffer, followed by generating
; an interrupt to the system. Once this is done, the system will read the data. By accessing the
; Status register, the interrupt will be reset. This is normal operation. For a write operation,
; The command is sent, then DRQ goes active, which requires the data be sent to the IDE Device.
; Once the data is written, an interrupt is generated after it's writing completed.
; As a result, there's little value of having an ISR for servicing the write function.
; As interrupts are enabled for the IDE Controller, all generated interrupts must be handled.
;
; Status Register bits as defined as follows:
;       - Bit 7 = Busy (a Command has been accepted)
;       - Bit 6 = Ready (IDE controller is ready to accept a command)
;       - Bit 5 = Write Fault (A write command failed against the media)
;       - Bit 4 = DSC (is set when a Seek is completed)
;       - Bit 3 = Data Request (set when there is data to transfer, read or write)
;       - Bit 2 = Correction (set when a recoverable data error was corrected)
;       - Bit 1 = 0 (not used)
;       - Bit 0 = Error (set when the previous command had an unrecoverable error)
;
;       NOTE: 25 clock cycles to here if DUART ISR is second!

;START OF TOP PAGE - DO NOT MOVE FROM THIS ADDRESS!! JUMP Table starts here.
; - BIOS calls are listed below - total of 32, Reserved calls are for future hardware support
; - "B_" JUMP Tables entries are for BIOS routines, provides isolation between Monitor and BIOS
; - Two new calls used for Benchmark Timer, calls 16/17 starting with CO2BIOS 2.02
; - One additional Benchmark Timer call to allow start/stop of timer without resetting it
; - New calls added for IDE Controller and RTC starting with C02BIOS 3.04
; - New calls added for second serial port starting with C02BIOS 4.00
; - New calls added to Enable/Disable IDE Write Cache (Hitachi 3K8 Microdrive) C02BIOS 4.00
; - EXE_XLDLY has been removed, not really used, frees a Page Zero location used for IDE now
;
; NOTE: All Jump table calls add 3 clock cycles to execution time for each BIOS function.
